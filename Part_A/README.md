# RPCN Assignments
This Python project uses BagPy to read .bag files. Documentation can be found here: https://jmscslgroup.github.io/bagpy/getting_started.html

### Installation
I use Poetry for python dependency management and virtual environment stuff. You can install it here: https://python-poetry.org/ 

1. Clone this repository
1. Add the `.bag` files in the `data` directory.
1. Run `$ poetry install` to create a virtual environment and install dependencies
1. Run `$ poetry shell` to enter the virtual environment
1. Run `$ python main.py` to start the program
